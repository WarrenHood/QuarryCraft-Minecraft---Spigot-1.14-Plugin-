**Making the quarry**

Firstly, place down a chest one block above the level at which you want to start mining.

Then place a diamond block against each side face of the chest to get a cross.


Next, fill the 4 open corners with redston blocks.

Next, you may place iron bars heading staight out in the north,south, west and/or east direction. Starting from the side of each diamond block.

The 2 longest perpendicular bars will be used to determine the area which your quarry will mine.

Now shift-left click the chest in the centre.

It will complain that there is no fuel. You can use charcoal, coal, or redstone as fuel. Charcoal is the least efficient, while the next are twice as efficient as the previous. coal blocks and restone blocks may also be used. This is equiavelent to 9 coal or 9 redstone dust.

**Here is a summary of the energy provided by each material:**

Charcoal - 25 Energy

Coal - 50 Energy

Redstone - 100 Energy

Coal Block - 450 Energy

Redstone Block - 900 Energy

The quarry will consume energy equivalent to the hardness value of each block it mines.

**Next, you will need storage for the mined items.**

Simply place chests or double chests anywhere along the iron bars (They must be touching the sides of the iron bars).

The quarry will then begin to mine.

**Mining Modes**
Shift-left-click your centre chest to toggle between classic and ender mining. Ender mining will cost 50 times as much as classic mining, however it will not mine stone, dirt, or grass. Ender mining can also place dirt blocks in place of the blocks it mines to avoid holes in the ground. See the nether star modifier below.


**Modifiers**

Place a chest on any of the redstone corners.

Then you can place either emerald blocks, diamond blocks, or a nether star in that chest above the redstone.

Summary of modifiers:

Emerald Blocks- Reduce mining delay by 1 tick for every 4 emerald blocks. Max is 76 emerald blocks.

Diamond Blocks - Increases the number of blocks mined at a time by 1 for every diamond block. Max is 36 diamond blocks.

Gold Blocks - Increases the efficiency of the quarry. Max is about 99% efficiency at 100 gold blocks.

Nether Star - Place a single nether star in a chest above the redstone to enable dirt block replacements for mined blocks in the ender mining mode.

**Block Filters**

Place a shulker shell on any of the redstone corners. Then place blocks you want to void into the shulker shell. The quarry will still mine all the blocks it usually does and use the same energy, but it will save you space so your chests won't be full of blocks you don't want.


**Viewing the current y-level the quarry is mining on**

Sneak right click the centre chest to find out how far down the quarry is mining at the moment.

**Resetting the current y-level to the top**

If, for whatever reason, you want the quarry to restart mining at the top. Sneak left click one of the 4 diamond blocks around the centre chest. It will start mining at the top(given that there are now blocks at the top that you want mined)
